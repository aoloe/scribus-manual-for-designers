#Freedom

- "free your talents !"
- "free your skills !"

... and for sure, if the designer believes in free software, he may be interested in using scribus...

but scribus niche is not so wide for free-agnostic people

#Cost and legality
- "Dont spend 1000s every year for software !"
- jLuc: "Free yourself off piracy and become free software powerusers"
a.l.e: we were thinking about it yesterday evening: announce a scribus workshop and when everbody is downloading scribus, let somebody disguised in a police (wo)man come into the room and check the computers for non correclty licensed software) (ok, i thought about the real police getting in :-)

# Customized to your needs

getting in touch with the community and getting the software changed to match your needs is also a potential advantage...

jLuc: "talk with developpers about your dreams and help them create better tools"

# Usecases

the main one  i could think of is: if an association asks you to help out with a newsletter, do it with scribus so you can get them to do the further work of layouting...
... since they won't pay you for (all) the work you will be doing, it's an advantage for the designer to be able to get the client to download scribus for free...

the low-budget user can also work on the text in a by-the-designer proposed design
exactly, this is the largest use case i can currently conceive: clients on tight budget that are ready to do most of the time intensive work by themselves...
